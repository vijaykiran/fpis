* Chapter 2 - Getting Started with FP in Scala
- HOF - Higher Order Functions
- Recursive functions instead of loops.
- Take functions as arguments and *may* return functions as return values.
- Polymorphics higher-order functions
- `object` creates singletons, equivalent to an instance of an anonymous class in Java
- No `static` keyword in scala
- Loosely, every value in scala is an *object*
- `object` is-a *module* is-a *namespace*
- while loop hinders good compositional style (?)
- very short variable names in FP
- (Parametrically) Polymorphic Functions - polymorphic over the types of arguments (not talking about inheritance polymorphism)
- If a function is polymorphic in some type A, the only operations than can be performed on A are those passed into the function as arguments
